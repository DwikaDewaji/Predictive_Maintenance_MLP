## Introduction
This project focuses on creating a machine learning model to classify type of machine failure representing No Failure, Heat Dissipation Failure, Power Failure, Overstrain Failure, Tool Wear Failure, & Random Failures. Using Multi Layer Perceptron algorithm and a diverse dataset, the model aims to accurately identify each type of failure, enabling applications machinery, and more. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to ensure high performance and reliability.

## Features
- **Collecting Data**: Collect data from github.
- **Pre-Processing Data**: Resizinh data for accurate analysis.
- **Image Classification**: Using NN models to classify images.



## Usability
1. Run a RPS_Classification script to classify images:
    ```sh
    python RPS_Classification.ipynb
    ```


## Project Structure
- `RPS_Classification.ipynb`: Preprocessing and predicting output. 
- `requirements.txt`: List of required dependencies.
